                        I am a joyful, simple person who indulges far too frequently in the sea of information that this century provides. My fascination with digital technology began when I was about eight years old and was given access to my first computer, which piqued my interest in playing games and the possibilities they inspired.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        I plunge into the newest technologies knowing that they can solve a problem that has never been solved before because I've built my abilities and expertise around this technology.

                    <h3 class="sub__heading__section"> High School </h3>     
                    <p>
                        When I finally went to high school I was doubting which direction to go, do I go for my passion in digital or do I follow in the footsteps of my dad who is a Mechanic Specializing in Mercedes Benz.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was a hard crossing road and I knew I had to make a swift choice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I landed in a Technical High School, perfect for following in the footsteps of my dad but on arrival, I found they also offer IT, and then it clicked…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That’s where I am going !!
                    </p>                    
                    <h3 class="sub__heading__section"> Decided to start taking it seriously </h3>  
                    <p>
                        In my first class of Information Technology, I was sitting in anticipation to hear what it is all about excited to learn all about c++ which I completed a tutorial in the holidays. To my surprise the actual focus was Delphi Language, which had no real practical use I thought.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Neglecting that cloud of expectation I started doing my own studies and learned HTML, CSS & Javascript which would later be my niche area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After high school, I’ve completed several tutorials and short courses on many areas of interest. I fully embraced a road of self-study. Having little resources and money I had to make due.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="sub__heading__section"> Since </h3>
                    <p>
                        I now mostly do freelance websites as well as graphic design, which lead to my study of User Experience Design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have created numerous designs and built many websites, also I have created a color-picking app called Zest which is on Github. My portfolio showcases some art and links to check out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With this feel free to connect with me if you are interested, we all have hidden talents and all we need to do is believe in ourselves.
